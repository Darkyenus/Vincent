                In the following test, you will evaluate the wine taste as it evolves over time.
                Do not drink until prompted to and then try to answer each question as soon as it appears,
                with the response that is appropriate at the time of response.
                If you don't manage to respond in the given time limit, just continue as if nothing had happened,
                it will not prevent you from continuing. Nevertheless, please try to respond to all questions.

                This is just an example! You can practise answering time-gated questions here, but <b>do not drink any wine </b> prior.
                This is not a part of the evaluation.
