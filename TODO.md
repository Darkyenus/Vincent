# Implement
- Collect demographic information for registered panelists
- `<section shown-wine` - check css

- Do not allow to open questionnaire when there are wine code duplicates
    - Highlight duplicates
    - Name duplicates are allowed
- Add (dynamically shown) save button to single field forms
- Display gender and intolerances in the questionnaire's participant list 
- Allow to invite everyone from some other questionnaire, creating a dependency
- Implement guest accounts, with separate codes (hmm)
    - Something like #G341234
- Implement "Registered users list"
    - Show all collected info to administrators
    - Show only Name, Email, Phone, Code and intolerances to regular staff
        - Is this ok? Ask!
