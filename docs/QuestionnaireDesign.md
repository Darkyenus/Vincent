# Questionnaire files
Questionnaire files define the structure of a questionnaire run.
Specifically, they define the questions that the questionnaire consists of,
their types, machine-readable names, user presentation, etc.

They do not define what is the questionnaire about - for example the wine about which the questionnaire is,
is not defined by these files.

Questionnaire files are defined in [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) because it is well suited for this.
